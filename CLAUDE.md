## Project memory (agent-memoize MCP)

- At session start, call `memoize_status` once. If entries are stale, re-read only the listed
  files — do not rescan the project. `verified` entries are already fresh (auto re-baselined);
  `suspended` entries need their sources fixed via `memoize_update`.
- Before exploring the codebase, call `memoize_recall`. Recall a topic before reading the files
  it describes; if the memory is fresh and sufficient, skip reading them.
- After editing files, call `memoize_update` for each affected entry (kind="file", with
  `sources`). Create entries as you learn the project: architecture, conventions, gotchas.
  Producer plugins are sources of truth — follow the producer guidance in the
  `memoize_update` tool description.
- Record user decisions and preferences with `memoize_update` (kind="decision", no sources).
- Memory guides navigation only: always read a file before editing it, even if memory
  describes it.
